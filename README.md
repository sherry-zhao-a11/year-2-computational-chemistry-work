# Computational Chemistry: H√ºckel Theory vs Density Functional Theory (DFT)

This repository presents a **computational chemistry project** that integrates **Python programming**, **quantum theory**, and **molecular orbital analysis**.  
The goal is to compare the effectiveness of **H√ºckel Molecular Orbital (HMO) theory** and **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** in modeling œÄ-electron systems and UV-Vis absorption spectra of conjugated organic molecules.

## üß† Overview

This project combines **computer science** and **chemistry** to explore how computational models can predict molecular electronic structures.  
Through both simplified (H√ºckel) and advanced (DFT) quantum mechanical methods, we analyze molecules such as:

- Ethene  
- Propene  
- Butadiene  
- Cyclobutadiene  
- Cyclopentadienyl radical, cation, and anion  
- Benzene

## ‚öôÔ∏è Computational Methods

### **1. H√ºckel Theory (Python Implementation)**  
- Constructed and diagonalized the **H√ºckel Hamiltonian matrix** using Python.  
- The Hamiltonian represents œÄ orbital interactions between carbon atoms via two parameters:  
  - **Œ± (on-site energy)**  
  - **Œ≤ (interaction energy)**  
- Solved the **eigenvalue problem** `|H - EI| = 0` to obtain:  
  - **Eigenvalues ‚Üí** œÄ orbital energies  
  - **Eigenvectors ‚Üí** molecular orbital coefficients  
- Visualization of œÄ molecular orbitals (Œ®‚ÇÅ, Œ®‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶) for each compound.

### **2. Density Functional Theory (DFT, WebMO)**  
- Performed DFT calculations using **B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory.  
- Considered **electron‚Äìelectron interactions** and **exchange‚Äìcorrelation effects**, absent in H√ºckel theory.  
- Predicted **total molecular energies**, **HOMO‚ÄìLUMO gaps**, and **UV-Vis absorption transitions**.
